# Sprint5

## Countdown with a date input

### To consider: 
  Due to sprint requirements, https requests were implemented with axios, therefore, the database located in the DB folder must be turned on. 
  This is done with the command "json-server --watch DB/DB.json". 
  
  Also, remember that to open with the LiveServer extension, only the "web" folder must be open in the VS editor.
